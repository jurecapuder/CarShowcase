## About

Car Hub is a simple yet effective landing page for a car rental website. It provides users with a glimpse of the available cars, allowing them to view car details and rental prices. The website is designed to be user-friendly, with three main sections:

- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing introduction to the Car Hub website, featuring stunning car images and a clear call to action.

- **Car Catalogue**: Explore our catalogue of rental cars, where you can view car details and find out how much it costs to rent them.

- **Footer**: A footer section with essential links and information to help users navigate the website.

This project serves as a starting point for a full-fledged car rental platform, and it's perfect for developers looking to build upon this foundation.
